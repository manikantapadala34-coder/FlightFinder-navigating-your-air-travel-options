Title: FlightFinder: A Comprehensive Flight Booking Application using MERN Stack

Abstract:
The FlightFinder application is a modern web-based platform designed to simplify the airline reservation process.
Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js),
the system provides a seamless experience for both users and administrators.

The application features a robust User Authentication system and real-time flight search capabilities, 
allowing customers to view, book, and manage their flight reservations efficiently. For administrative efficiency,
a dedicated Admin Dashboard is integrated to manage flight schedules and monitor bookings.
The project emphasizes scalability by utilizing MongoDB Atlas for cloud data storage,
while also providing a local database fallback to ensure high availability and performance across different network environments. 
This system modernizes flight reservations by reducing manual intervention and improving booking accuracy.
